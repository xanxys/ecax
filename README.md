ECAX: Elementary Cellular Automaton eXplorer
=======

Super fast elementary cellular automata viewer in HTML5.

It uses a variant of hashlife algorithm to run/render ECA.


Why it's named rule110?
-------
Originally this was a "Rule 110 viewer & CTS translator".
However, it turned out running the tiniest CTS requires thousands (or millions) of nodes, so I decided
to make fast, /super/-fast, ECA viewer first.
